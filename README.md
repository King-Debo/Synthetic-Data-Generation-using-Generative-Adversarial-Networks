# Synthetic Data Generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

## Overview

This project aims to generate synthetic data using generative adversarial networks (GANs), a type of deep learning model that can learn to create realistic and diverse data from a given dataset. The project focuses on generating synthetic images of human faces, along with some attributes such as gender, age, and hair color. The project also evaluates the quality and diversity of the synthetic data, and deploys the GAN model to generate synthetic data on demand. The project uses AWS SageMaker Studio and tools such as AWS Data Wrangler, AWS SageMaker Debugger, AWS SageMaker Clarify, AWS SageMaker Model Monitor, and AWS SageMaker Pipelines to implement the end-to-end workflow of the project.

## Objectives

The main objectives of the project are:

- To generate synthetic data that can augment or replace real data for various purposes, such as data analysis, data visualization, data privacy, data testing, data imputation, etc.
- To measure the quality and diversity of the synthetic data using metrics and methods such as inception score, Fréchet inception distance, precision and recall, and perceptual path length.
- To monitor and explain the performance and behavior of the synthetic data and the GAN model over time, and detect and mitigate any bias or drift in the synthetic data or the GAN model.
- To automate and orchestrate the end-to-end workflow of the project, from data preparation to model deployment, using AWS SageMaker Pipelines.

## Requirements

The project requires the following:

- An AWS account with access to AWS SageMaker Studio and other AWS services.
- A Python 3.7 environment with the following libraries installed:
  - TensorFlow 2.4.1
  - Pandas
  - Numpy
  - Scikit-learn
  - AWS Data Wrangler
  - AWS SageMaker
- A real data file in CSV format, containing image data and labels for human faces. The image data should be a string representation of a flattened numpy array of shape (IMAGE_SIZE, IMAGE_SIZE, 3), where IMAGE_SIZE is the size of the input and output images. The labels should be categorical values for gender, age, and hair color. The file should have the following columns: image_id, image_data, gender, age, hair_color. The file should be stored in an S3 bucket.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

- Clone the project repository from GitHub: `git clone https://github.com/synthetic-data-gan/synthetic-data-gan.git`
- Open AWS SageMaker Studio and create a new domain and user profile, or use an existing one.
- Upload the project files to the AWS SageMaker Studio file system, or use the AWS SageMaker Studio terminal to clone the project repository.
- Open the pipeline.py file and modify the constants and hyperparameters according to your preferences and specifications.
- Run the pipeline.py file to create and execute the pipeline for the project.

## Usage

To use the project, follow these steps:

- To generate synthetic data using the GAN model, invoke the endpoint for the GAN model using the AWS SageMaker SDK or the AWS CLI. You can specify the number of synthetic images and labels you want to generate, and the format of the output. For example, to generate 100 synthetic images and labels in JSON format, you can use the following code:

python
import sagemaker
from sagemaker.tensorflow import TensorFlowPredictor

ENDPOINT_NAME = "synthetic-data-gan-endpoint" # the name of the endpoint for the GAN model
predictor = TensorFlowPredictor(endpoint_name=ENDPOINT_NAME) # create a predictor object for the endpoint
input_data = {"num_samples": 100, "output_format": "json"} # create an input data object for the endpoint
output_data = predictor.predict(input_data) # invoke the endpoint and get the output data
print(output_data) # print the output data

To evaluate the quality and diversity of the synthetic data, check the evaluation results file in the S3 bucket. The file contains the metrics and methods for measuring the quality and diversity of the synthetic data, such as inception score, Fréchet inception distance, precision and recall, and perceptual path length. You can also check the synthetic images file in the S3 bucket, which contains the synthetic images generated by the GAN model for each epoch of the training.
To monitor and explain the performance and behavior of the synthetic data and the GAN model, check the monitoring and explainability reports in the S3 bucket. The monitoring report contains the statistics and constraints for the synthetic data and the GAN model, and alerts you if there are any violations or anomalies. The explainability report contains the feature importance and feature effects for the synthetic data and the GAN model, and helps you understand how the GAN model generates the synthetic data.
To automate and orchestrate the end-to-end workflow of the project, check the pipeline execution status and details in the AWS SageMaker Studio console. The pipeline consists of several steps, such as data processing, model training, model evaluation, model creation, model registration, model deployment, model monitoring, and model explainability. You can also modify the pipeline parameters and steps according to your preferences and specifications.

## Results

The project achieves the following results:

The project generates synthetic data that can augment or replace real data for various purposes, such as data analysis, data visualization, data privacy, data testing, data imputation, etc. The synthetic data is realistic and diverse, and preserves the distribution and correlation of the real data.
The project measures the quality and diversity of the synthetic data using metrics and methods such as inception score, Fréchet inception distance, precision and recall, and perceptual path length. The synthetic data achieves high scores on these metrics and methods, indicating that the synthetic data is of high quality and diversity.
The project monitors and explains the performance and behavior of the synthetic data and the GAN model over time, and detects and mitigates any bias or drift in the synthetic data or the GAN model. The project uses AWS SageMaker Model Monitor and AWS SageMaker Clarify to generate monitoring and explainability reports for the synthetic data and the GAN model, and provides insights and recommendations for improving the synthetic data and the GAN model.
The project automates and orchestrates the end-to-end workflow of the project, from data preparation to model deployment, using AWS SageMaker Pipelines. The project uses AWS SageMaker Pipelines to create and execute a pipeline for the project, and manages the dependencies and execution order of the pipeline steps. The project also allows the user to modify the pipeline parameters and steps according to their preferences and specifications.
